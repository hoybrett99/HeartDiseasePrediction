# Heart Disease Risk Predictor

This repository contains an analysis of heart disease using various machine learning and statistical techniques. The analysis is conducted in R programming language and utilizes several libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

## Overview

Heart disease is a significant health concern worldwide, and understanding its risk factors and prediction methods is crucial for preventive healthcare. This analysis aims to explore the relationship between various factors such as smoking, physical health, age, and gender with the incidence of heart disease. It employs several machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to predict heart disease risk and identify significant predictors.

## Key Indicators of Heart Disease

The dataset used in this analysis is derived from the 2022 annual CDC survey data, which includes information from over 250,000 adults regarding their health status. Key indicators of heart disease include:

- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Smoking
- Diabetes status
- Obesity (high BMI)
- Lack of physical activity
- Excessive alcohol consumption

Detecting and preventing these risk factors is essential in healthcare, and machine learning methods can help identify patterns in the data to predict a patient's condition.

## Dataset Source and Processing

The dataset originates from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to collect data on the health status of U.S. residents. With over 400,000 adult interviews conducted each year, BRFSS is the largest continuously conducted health survey system globally. The dataset used in this analysis includes data from 2020 and has been processed to select the most relevant variables related to heart disease.
