# Heart Disease Risk Predictor

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict heart disease risk using machine learning techniques and provide an accessible tool for risk assessment.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Developed using logistic regression
- **Input Factors**: Age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators
- **Web Application**: Currently building using R Shiny for user interaction
- **Ongoing Improvements**: Continuously refining the model for better accuracy

## How It Works

1. Users input their health data through a user-friendly interface
2. The app processes the data using the trained logistic regression model
3. An immediate risk assessment for heart disease is provided

## Potential Applications

- Preliminary screenings during routine medical check-ups
- Assisting healthcare providers in identifying patients who may need further cardiovascular evaluation

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Machine Learning
- Statistical Analysis
- Web Application Development (R Shiny)
- Data Modeling and Interpretation

## Current Status

The web application is under development, with simultaneous efforts to improve the underlying predictive model's accuracy.

## Future Plans

- Complete the web application development
- Enhance model accuracy through further data analysis and feature engineering
- Conduct user testing and gather feedback for improvements
